The picture you provided shows small, dome-shaped bumps with a central depression, which is a distinctive characteristic of this condition. 

Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a virus that infects the skin and causes these small, benign growths. It's highly contagious and can be spread through skin-to-skin contact or by sharing personal care items. Treatment options include topical creams or ointments, cryotherapy, or excision. Prevention involves practicing good hygiene, avoiding close contact with others, and not sharing personal items. It's essential to consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment, as self-medication can lead to further complications.",,2025-02-28 22:38:40.161722
